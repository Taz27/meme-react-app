# Meme Generator App

I have coded this app using **ReactJS** which fetches memes data from *imgflip API (https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes)* and loads the MemeGenerator React component with a randomly selected image. Users are able to create memes by adding *Top-Text* and *Bottom-Text* on images displayed.
